# arkham-companion
Arkham Companion replaces the Location and Other World decks in Fantasy Flight Games' Arkham Horror boardgame. It helps speed up setup and play as it automatically filters by expansion and, for Other World, by color. Arkham Companion shuffles the decks for you and keeps a history of your encounters.
